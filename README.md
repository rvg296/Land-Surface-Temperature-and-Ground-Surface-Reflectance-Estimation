# Land Surface Temperature and Ground Surface Reflectance estimation from Landsat TM Thermal infrared and Optical Data

Land surface Temperature (LST) and Ground surface reflectance (GSR) are some of the important parameters in the field of remote sensing whose estimation is necessary.  The former is used to estimate the temperature of a particular chosen surface which the satellite sensor sees through and the latter helps in finding out the characteristics of the objects or features or targets under consideration. The manual measurement of both the parameters through the acquisition of field data is tedious and time consuming where as many satellites provides a data which covers huge areas and are free of cost, but these are available in the form of Digital Number (DN). Hence there is a need to convert these DN values to LST and GSR using suitable band data for further applications. 

In the present work a methodology has been adopted which integrates the concept of computer programming and Digital Number conversion to estimate both the parameters. In the case of ground surface reflectance estimation, the digital numbers are corrected for atmospheric effects and provided as input. This methodology was applied for a particular study area by acquiring its satellite imagery bands (thermal and optical bands) and the results have been achieved and studied. The results found were adequate to check out the land surface temperature and ground reflectance values of each and every pixel of the Digital Satellite imagery bands. Hence this methodology has a vast application in finding out the temperature and reflectance in a systematic and simple way, where the manual measurement through field data acquisition is difficult.
